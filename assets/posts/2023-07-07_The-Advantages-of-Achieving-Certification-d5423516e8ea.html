While this approach can be effective, you may eventually question whether you‚Äôre doing everything correctly or using the best practices. In this article, I want to share my personal experience and emotions after passing the Angular certification exam. Although my focus is on Angular, the insights I‚Äôll discuss apply to developers working with any language or framework. So, whether you‚Äôre a Google Developer Expert or simply interested in my story, join me as we delve into the world of certifications.</p><h4 name="d349" id="d349" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why pursue certification?</h4><p name="b8c0" id="b8c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">First and foremost, certification offers a valuable opportunity to improve your theoretical skills during the preparation process. This aspect alone is worth the investment of time and effort. The preparation covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics like content projection in Angular, filling any knowledge gaps you might have and enabling you to easily pass the theoretical portion of the exam.</p><p name="980c" id="980c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, the practical part of the exam challenges you to write code within specific task parameters. This requirement pushes you to grow as a developer, encouraging you to think critically and adhere to coding standards and best practices.</p><h4 name="222f" id="222f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Time commitment:</h4><p name="ec38" id="ec38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Contrary to popular belief, you don‚Äôt have to spend all your time cramming information. I recommend dedicating just 20‚Äì30 minutes per day to learn something new, such as reading articles or watching instructional videos. Once you feel ready, you can proceed to the theoretical test, which usually takes around 30‚Äì40 minutes. The coding portion requires approximately 3‚Äì5 hours to complete a small project, but the good news is that you can spread this time over 5‚Äì10 days.</p><h4 name="69a9" id="69a9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What if you don‚Äôt¬†pass?</h4><p name="f794" id="f794" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you don‚Äôt pass the exam on your first attempt, don‚Äôt be disheartened. The primary goal is to acquire new knowledge and become a stronger developer. With a dedicated effort during the preparation phase, you will have gained valuable insights. However, if you‚Äôre a perfectionist, you can always make another attempt in the future. Remember, successfully passing the exam comes with its own set of benefits.</p><h4 name="0de2" id="0de2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The benefits of certification:</h4><p name="a32b" id="a32b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Certifications hold immense value as credentials, providing tangible proof of your expertise and dedication to development. Employers and clients recognize certified developers as professionals who possess in-depth knowledge and practical skills in the framework. By earning a certification, you enhance your credibility and significantly increase your chances of securing job roles or freelance opportunities.</p><h4 name="78a1" id="78a1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Any potential downsides?</h4><p name="eb17" id="eb17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">While it‚Äôs challenging to pinpoint specific disadvantages, it‚Äôs worth mentioning one potential drawback: the cost. Well-known organizations offering certifications often charge a fee for their services. However, considering the knowledge and opportunities gained in return, this cost is relatively minor.</p><h4 name="94aa" id="94aa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Networking and community</h4><p name="9011" id="9011" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">I‚Äôd like to highlight another advantage of pursuing certification‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe opportunity to network and engage with a vibrant community. During the course, you‚Äôll have the chance to connect with talented developers and industry experts. Personally, I‚Äôve gained immense value from interacting with Angular and Google Developer Experts like <a href="https://medium.com/@angulartraining" data-href="https://medium.com/@angulartraining" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Alain Chautard</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannick-boetzkes-a90500183/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannick-boetzkes-a90500183/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yannick Boetzkes</a>.</p></div></div></section><section name="8039" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="863c" id="863c" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Embarking on the journey of certification unlocks numerous benefits. From improving your skills and boosting your credibility to enhancing employability and accessing a supportive community, the advantages are plentiful. While there may be a nominal cost involved, the knowledge and recognition you gain far outweigh the investment. So, seize the opportunity, enhance your expertise, and become a certified developer ready to tackle exciting challenges in the world of web development.</p><p name="4fff" id="4fff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thanks for your attention, if you like this article you can üëè¬†, follow me and write a comment.</p></div></div></section>
